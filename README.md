# htbfy
âž” CLI client for the HackTheBox API.

# Why ?
Because I hate leaving my terminal. The terminal is love, the terminal is life. Amen. Accept it. Embrace it. Thank me later.  
Also, I'm a hacker, not a professional programmer. My code could probably be more efficient and cleaner, whatever, if it works, it works.

# HTB app token
This script uses **dotenv** to load the HTB app token in an environment variable called **HTB_APP_TOKEN**. You can get yours from your HTB profile/profile settings, create app token. It's only available for 1 year max, so be mindful of that. Put the app token in the .env file under the same directory as this script.  
```
$ ls
.env htbfy.py
$ cat .env
HTB_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token_here
```

# Installation
## Using python3's venv module
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tropkal/htbfy
$ cd htbfy  
$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ . venv/bin/activate  
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Using uv
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tropkal/htbfy  
$ cd htbfy  
$ uv venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate  
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
This script is by no means complete when it comes to the HTB API, but it can do some basic things (at least for now), like spawning, terminating, resetting, extending a machine's time. It can also fetch: the current seasonal rank, a list of the active machines, the current active machine and the time left on it, the connection status of the VPN, and it can also search for any machine and retrieve some information on it like its OS, difficulty, etc.

I'll maybe add functionality later regarding challenges, fortresses and/or whatever else. Maybe. For now, this works for me.
